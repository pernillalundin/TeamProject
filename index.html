    <p>
        The Helix Nebula (also known as NGC 7293 or Caldwell 63) is a planetary nebula (PN) located in the constellation
        Aquarius. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Discovered by Karl Ludwig Harding, probably before 1824, this object is one of the closest to the
        Earth of all the bright planetary nebulae.</p> 
    <p>
        The distance, measured by the Gaia mission, is 655±13
        light-years.
    </p> 
    <p>
        It is similar in appearance to the Cat's Eye Nebula and the Ring Nebula, whose size, age, and
        physical characteristics are similar to the Dumbbell Nebula, varying only in its relative proximity and the
        appearance from the equatorial viewing angle.
    </p> 
    <p>     
        The Helix Nebula has sometimes been referred to as the "Eye of
        God" in pop culture, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron#Eye_of_Sauron" target="_blank">"Eye of Sauron" </a>.
